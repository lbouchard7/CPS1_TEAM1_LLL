## The Living Link Lab: What is it and why are ethics a consideration? 

The Living Link Lab is a testbed for deploying and testing technology designed to monitor occupants, implement autonomous robots as sensors, and monitor ambient building conditions. This exists within the Link Lab, a pre-existing office space housing over 100 research assistants and faculty.

Beyond the fact that ethics must always be addressed for projects relating to human subjects, systems involving artificial or intelligent systems (A/IS) must be more carefully scrutinized since this emerging field has few established ethical standards, yet a significant potential to impact human lives. 

An official, yet sparse, website for the project is maintained [here](https://living.linklab.virginia.edu/). More information about the Link Lab can be found [here](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab-0).

## About our recommendations

One set of existing ethical guidelines for A/IS systems is [_Ethically Aligned Design_](https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/), published by IEEE. We use this framework as a basis to form recommendations for actions Living Link Lab researchers can take to ensure their project results in the greatest benefit to all stakeholders.

We believe such actions will make the project as a whole more successful. Moreover, we assert that a thorough, well-documented, and effectively implemented consideration of ethics in the Living Link Lab project will put the project at the forefront of ethical design in A/IS systems. 

The recommendations, and potentially resulting actions on behalf of the researchers, will serve as an example for similar future A/IS research project. 

## The Recommendations

### Human Rights and Data Agency

- Grant visitors and residents the right to obtain any data collected of them
- Provide any occupant of the Link Lab the choice to consent to having their data collected or to decline to participate, without retaliation
- Allow every data subject the right to have their data removed from the system
- Mitigate any potential bias in the processing of data

### Well-Being

- Ensure the safety of any actuated systems including automated building controls and autonomous robots
- there is another bullet in our doc that I am not sure relates to the EAD

### Transparancy and Accountability

- The rational behind autonomous decisions should be available to all stakeholders
- Researchers should identify the legally responsible party in the event the project results in harm to individuals or property

### Awareness of Misuse

- Data should only be used for the intended purpose, even internally
- Data storage should be designed to gaurd personal data from external entities
- A review board should be formed to handle and investigate claims of data misuse
- An enforcement mechanism should be established to deter misuse
