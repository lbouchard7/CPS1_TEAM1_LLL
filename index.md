## The Living Link Lab: What is it and why are ethics a consideration? 

The Living Link Lab is a testbed for deploying and testing technology designed to monitor occupants, implement autonomous robots as sensors, and monitor ambient building conditions. This exists within the Link Lab, a pre-existing office space housing over 100 research assistants and faculty.

Beyond the fact that ethics must always be addressed for projects relating to human subjects, systems involving artificial or intelligent systems (A/IS) must be more carefully scrutinized since this emerging field has few established ethical standards, yet a significant potential to impact human lives. 

An official, yet sparse, website for the project is maintained [here](https://living.linklab.virginia.edu/). More information about the Link Lab can be found [here](https://engineering.virginia.edu/link-lab-0).

## About our recommendations

One set of existing ethical guidelines for A/IS systems is [_Ethically Aligned Design_](https://ethicsinaction.ieee.org/), published by IEEE. We use this framework as a basis to form [recommendations](https://lbouchard7.github.io/CPS1_TEAM1_LLL/Key_Recommendations) for actions Living Link Lab researchers can take to ensure their project results in the greatest benefit to all stakeholders.

We believe such actions will make the project as a whole more successful. Moreover, we assert that a thorough, well-documented, and effectively implemented consideration of ethics in the Living Link Lab project will put the project at the forefront of ethical design in A/IS systems. 

The recommendations, and potentially resulting actions on behalf of the researchers, will serve as an example for similar future A/IS research project.
