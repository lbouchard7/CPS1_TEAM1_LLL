## The Living Link Lab: What is it and why are ethics a consideration? 

The Living Link Lab is a testbed for deploying and testing technology designed to monitor occupants, implement autonomous robots as sensors, and monitor ambient building conditions. This exists within the Link Lab, a pre-existing office space housing over 100 research assistants and faculty.
